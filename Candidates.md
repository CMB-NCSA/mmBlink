# 9. Benjamin Hall-Skank
1st choice, graduating 2028

## Motivation

Ever since I was little, I loved to read about the universe. Every night, I would stay up late to pour over images of stars, nebulae, and black holes. Here were objects that were unfathomably far away, and yet, so much was known of them. I couldn't believe that it was possible to learn so much just by asking questions about the world. As I grew up, that fascination never left me. Each year I would find myself taking more advanced classes to study the things around myself. When it came to choosing a major for college the choice was obvious: physics, the study of everything. That childhood itch to learn is something more now - it's a lifestyle. I can't imagine a life without diving deep into some niche topic. But, simply learning about something isnt the same as being able to interact with it yourself. Working at the NCSA, I would be able to join a team thats working at the forefront of discovery. Instead of just reading about the world, I would actually be a part of a team helping to uncover the mysteries of the universe. Instead of just keeping that wonder and awe for myself I would be able to help share it with others.

## Skills & Experience

Cleaning dishes isnt the most glamorous job, but it's honest work. It didnt matter whether it was the senior residents dirty plates, a burnt casserole, or a jug of spoiled yogurt it all went through to me. For three hours a shift Id scrape, spray, and wipe down every dirty utensil in the kitchen. It didnt matter how gag worthy the item was to begin with, by the time I was done with it, it was as shiny as if it had just been bought. This kind of dedication to a craft isnt something that can be taught in a classroom, it has to be earned through countless hours of just getting the job done. Its that kind of dedication that I can bring to the table. Im someone thats willing to step up and get the job done. By pairing that with my physics and coding curriculum Im more than willing to dive straight into a SPIN project and begin working on building something new.

## Personal benefit

My cross-country coach had the double digit rule: as long as it was at least ten degrees outside in the winter and under one hundred in the summer we'd be outside running. It didn't matter whether there would be rain, wind, or snow our team would be outside. I loved the challenge. When the weather turned against me, that was just one more obstacle telling me I couldn't make it. Beating the weather was beating all my doubts that I wasn't up for the challenge. That kind of mentality and mindset doesn't just stay on the track. Heading into college Im already finishing up my final Gen Ed, I strengthened my prior coding experience from high school by exploring python in linear algebra and math applications, and I jumped straight into my physics curriculum taking both Introduction to Astrophysics and Relativity and Math Applications despite just being a freshman. Not only did I learn practical skills for my major, but I tested my limits. I challenged myself. By taking on a SPIN internship I will be able to push myself again. Instead of just letting the summer go by, I will be getting hands-on physics experience under the direction of a SPIN mentor. In this way I would be able to take my first steps into the professional world of physics. I would be able to prove to myself that I am more than capable of taking on this lifestyle and become a physicist someday.

Though I dont have much formal training, throughout my time in high school and college, Ive picked up a fair number of skills in computer science on my own. Perhaps the most important club I was part of in high school was the Cyber Defense Club. I was the leader of a team with three other people who were tasked with defending a network of servers in preparation for a real-time simulated attack by professional hackers as part of an annual competition at Iowa State University. We had to learn everything from how to use the Linux terminal to MySQL databases to active directories in order to patch major security holes before the attack started. Often, in the nights leading up to the competition, wed be on Discord calls trying to track down malicious crontab scripts and symbolic links to shadow files. One year, we placed so well we were invited to compete against the military of Kosovo in a special international competition. This club forced me to learn how to pick up computing skills very quickly, and as a result, Im now familiar with several flavors of Linux, different databases, multiple programming languages, and some networking. Id love to add more to this list, and an internship at NCSA would be a great way to do that.

## Personal benefit

I would love nothing more than to do research for the rest of my life. Science, especially physics, has interested me since elementary school when I read the Smithsonians Universe: The Definitive Visual Guide.
